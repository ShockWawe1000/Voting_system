# PHP Endorsement System
This is a simple PHP-based application that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
jQuery, and AJAX for the front-end and
PHP with MySQL for the back-end. 

## Guide on installation
When building this project i used XAMPP
with Apache and MySQL
You can use it, or use your own DB as long as its MySQL

If youre going with the XAMPP route start from step 1
otherwise go to step 6;

1. Download XAMPP and make sure you check PHPmyadmin, MySQL and PHP.
2. Once installed. head over to  .../xampp/htdocs/
3. Make a folder (ex. Website) and clone repo inside
4. Now open up XAMPP (youre going to have to use admin mode all throuought as XAMPP is buggy if not elevated)
5. Run Apache and MySQL (If you run into errors go to xampp/php/php.ini and uncomment the "extension=mysqli"
6. Go to [localhost](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) (or your db managment tool of choice)
7. Go to Import and drop the file from the project ( website/sql/db.sql )
8. Finnaly visit the website on [website](http://localhost/website/)
